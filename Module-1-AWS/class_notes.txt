IAM Service :::

	Identity and Access Management Service : 
	
	- Global Service
	
		- Used to Create User IDs 
		- Create User Groups
		- Define User Access Level
		- Create User Roles & Policies to access other aws resources 
		
		
		root user 	- Complete Access to AWS Resources
		
		Infra-Structure Management Team 
		
		dev user 	- Wants to create EC2 Instance ?
		Testing Teams 
		
		
		

	How to access AWS Console as a IAM User ?
	
	
	AWS ACCOUNT :
	
		root user account			# Default Account with full Administrator/Owner Access!
									# This will be at the Enterprise level
									# Using Email_ID and Password we can login.
	
	
		Dev_Team 					# User1 & Password and allow them to access the AWS Console with limited access.
		
		Testing Team 
		
		Infra-Structure Mgmt Team	
		
		
		
	AWS Console :
	
		root user 				# Admin User
		
		
		
	AWS Account :
	
		root Account 
			- It is used to setup the Account/ Administration activities 
			
			
		IAM Account 
		
		
	AWS User Management :

		We use IAM Service to Create and Manage the Users on AWS Platform
		
		IAM User Names are create by the Root User.
		
		Authentication :
		
			Who can Access ? using valid user credentials.
		
		www.gmail.com ==> Email Server ?
		
			valid email_id & Credential
			
			send/recv/delete -- Actions?
		
		
		Authorization :
		
			What can be done?
		
			send/recv/delete -- Actions?	


		RBAC :	Role Based Access Control :
		
		Server :
		
		Application Development Server :
		
			User : Sam wants to access the Application Development Server 
			Developer
			
				Valid User Name/Password 
				
				Logged In.		Successful		# Authentication
				
				Sam wants to Install a development Tool - 
				We never allow any developer to install any tool on this server. 
				Means, Developers are NOT-Authorized to Install any tool.
					
		
		
			Developers					
			
			Administrators ::
			
			User : John --> Admin user can able to login and install or manage any packages on this server.
			Means, only Admins are Authorized to install the tools
			
			RBAC : 
			
				Administrators
				
				Developers
				
				Testers 
				
			
			Server1 :
			
				Should be accessible only the Developers 
				
				developer1 --> allow access 
				developer2 --> allow access
			
				1000 developers -- looking for access ?
				
				We always manage the users as a group.
				
				As a best practise, it is always recommended to manage the users a group.
				
			
		
		
		
		user1			user2				user3				user4					user5
		
									sec grp
			ADMIN Group							DEVELOPER GROUP			
			
			
		The User Group is used to maintain the list of Users.
		The User Group will not any any group within that group. i.e., there is no sub-group concept in RBAC.
		
		User can be part of more than one group.
		
		
		Authentication:
		
			IAM Authentication Methods 
			
				- Password 
				
				- Access Token / Secret Keys 
				
				- MFA - Multi-Factor Authentication
				
				
		User Access :
		
		Resource Access :  We need to configure IAM 
		
		
		EC2 Instance :
		
			Linux Box :
			
				Storage/Database Service

	How to setup the previleges to that user based on Group level access 
	
	Role 
	
	Security Policies 
	
	
	1. Login to AWS Console as a root user
	
	
	User Groups :::

			- Used to maintain the set of users for easy management
			
			Steps: 
			
			- Create User Group
			- Assign any policy(Permission) to that group 
			- Add Users to that group 
			
			
	
	Users :::
		
			- Any individual who seek access to AWS Account 
			
			Steps:
			
			- Create User 
			- Assign the user to one or more user group
				Note: As a best practise, user should be part of a group.
			- The User permissions will be automatically assigned to that user through the user group.
			
	
	Roles :::
	
			- Role are set of credentials/access to any other resource

			- Create Role 
			- Attach the Policy that role 
	
	
	
	Policies :::

			Is the permission defined for any user/group or service.
