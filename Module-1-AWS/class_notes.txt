		- Define User Access Level
		- Create User Roles & Policies to access other aws resources 
		
		
		root user 	- Complete Access to AWS Resources
		
		Infra-Structure Management Team 
		
		dev user 	- Wants to create EC2 Instance ?
		Testing Teams 
		
		
		

	How to access AWS Console as a IAM User ?
	
	
	AWS ACCOUNT :
	
		root user account			# Default Account with full Administrator/Owner Access!
									# This will be at the Enterprise level
									# Using Email_ID and Password we can login.
	
	
		Dev_Team 					# User1 & Password and allow them to access the AWS Console with limited access.
		
		Testing Team 
		
		Infra-Structure Mgmt Team	
		
		
		
	AWS Console :
	
		root user 				# Admin User
		
		
		
	AWS Account :
	
		root Account 
			- It is used to setup the Account/ Administration activities 
			
			
		IAM Account 
		
		
	AWS User Management :

		We use IAM Service to Create and Manage the Users on AWS Platform
		
		IAM User Names are create by the Root User.
		
		Authentication :
		
			Who can Access ? using valid user credentials.
		
		www.gmail.com ==> Email Server ?
		
			valid email_id & Credential
			
			send/recv/delete -- Actions?
		
		
		Authorization :
		
			What can be done?
		
			send/recv/delete -- Actions?	


		RBAC :	Role Based Access Control :
		
		Server :
		
		Application Development Server :
		
			User : Sam wants to access the Application Development Server 
			Developer
			
				Valid User Name/Password 
				
				Logged In.		Successful		# Authentication
				
				Sam wants to Install a development Tool - 
				We never allow any developer to install any tool on this server. 
				Means, Developers are NOT-Authorized to Install any tool.
					
		
		
			Developers					
			
			Administrators ::
			
			User : John --> Admin user can able to login and install or manage any packages on this server.
			Means, only Admins are Authorized to install the tools
			
			RBAC : 
			
				Administrators
				
				Developers
				
				Testers 
				
			
			Server1 :
			
				Should be accessible only the Developers 
				
				developer1 --> allow access 
				developer2 --> allow access
			
				1000 developers -- looking for access ?
				
				We always manage the users as a group.
				
				As a best practise, it is always recommended to manage the users a group.
				
			
		
		
		
		user1			user2				user3				user4					user5
		
									sec grp
			ADMIN Group							DEVELOPER GROUP			
			
			
		The User Group is used to maintain the list of Users.
		The User Group will not any any group within that group. i.e., there is no sub-group concept in RBAC.
		
		User can be part of more than one group.
		
		
		Authentication:
		
			IAM Authentication Methods 
			
				- Password 
				
				- Access Token / Secret Keys 
				
				- MFA - Multi-Factor Authentication

	Environments ::::
	
Environments :

	Non-Prod Environments													Prod Environments

	Dev Environment
	
	Build Environment
		Build : is a process of compiling the source code and create artifacts(Binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.exec/*.dll)

		UAT - User Acceptance Testing 		===============>				Production Servers  
		
		
	AWS Services ::::

	Infra-Structure Admin Perspective 
	
		AWS Solutions Architects - Associate 	
	
	DevOps Perspective 
	
		DevOps Associate
		
		
	- It is used to automate the Continous Integration, Continous Deployment of IT Services.
	
		- Continous Integration is the capability of the dev team to Continously integrate their changes to further testing without impacting others.
		
		- Continous Deployment is the automated of Application Deployment to Production Environment without any manual intervension.
	
		- Deployment/Promotion is a process of copying the artifacts from one environment to another enviroment  
	
Environments : What is all about?

	Non-Production Environments	(VM)													Production Environments (LIVE Environment)
	
		Development Environment (VM)	Java Progam (High-level language)
		
			- completely owned by Dev Team 
			- Create the Source Code 
			
		Build Environment (VM)	
			- Application Build is the process of compiling the code and creating the artifacts(Binaries)
				- Low-Level Language(Artifacts)
		
			- Compile the Source Code 
			- Create Artifacts ( Binaries/Executables - *.war/*.jar/*.exec )
	
				Artifacts will be promoted to Test Environment for further testing 
					
				When you download a software thru internet?
					- *.exec file 
	
		Testing Environments	
			- This is owned by the Testing Team.
			- Testing Team will create Test Scenarios/Test Cases 
			
			QA Environment (VM) 	- QA Testing Team  *.war
				Funtional/Regression/Performance,....
				
				- Quality Assurance Testing 
				- Perform Automated QA Testing
		
			UAT Environment	(VM)			*.war						================>	Production Servers (VM) - *.war
				- User Acceptance Testing														For MobaXTerm, User Laptop/Desktop is the LIVE Environment 
				- Perform UAT Testing 
				- UAT Testing are done the by Business Users
				- UAT Testing will be done based on the real time production/customer data

			Eg.: 
			
				Tele-Comm Domain:
				
				Tele-Comm Service Providers 
				
				Tele-Comm SP1 - Introduce a new feature to their customers 

								for initial 1 or 2 months 	==> Release this new service to end-users - Mobile-App/Web Appln.
								Beta Testing 
								
								Business Users 


The Need for Environments ????	

	Tools:

		
		Non-Production Environments	(VM)	
		
			Dev Environment
				IDEs - Eclipse Based IDEs / 
				Integrated Development Environment - using this tool, developers will develop the source code 
			
			Build Environment
				Build Tools 
					- Maven/Gradle
					
			Testing 
			
				Testing Tools 
				
					TestNG
					Selenium					
					
		Production Environment - LIVE Environment 			
		
			- Web Application Server - Used to run the web application
				- httpd
				- Tomcat 
				- Nginx 
		
		
		
		
		EC2 Instance : DEV 
			- Create Application 
			
		EC2 Instance : BUILD 
			- Build Application 
			
		EC2 Instance : TEST 
			- Test Application
			
		EC2 Instance : PROD
			- Deploy Application
			
		
		
		Setup the Non-Prod Environments :::
				What should be the availability of the Non-Prod Environments ??
						- Non-Prod Environments should be available only during business hours.
							- 8AM - 10PM - Business Hours 
				
			VPC :
				Subnets :
				
					EC2 Instance1 : DEV 
						- Create Application 
						
					EC2 Instance2 : BUILD 
						- Build Application 
						
					EC2 Instance3 : TEST 
						- Test Application

			
		Setup the Prod-Environments ::: LIVE Environments
				What should be the availability of the Prod Environments ??	
					- Prod Environments should be available 24/7.
					- Zero - Downtime!
					
			How to ensure High Availability of Production Environments
										
			VPC:	
				Subnet :
					EC2 Instance : PROD
						- Deploy Application
						
						
					Deployment Group :
					
						Group of Servers using for production deployment 
						
						Deployment_Group 
								- VM1,2,3,4,5
								
						www.amazon.com 	- E_Commerce 
						
						Online Ticket Booking System -- Train Tickets
						
							Deployment_Group - Is the replica of servers 
								How to create the replicas of servers - using the image copy 
								- VM1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10	
								
							Auto-Scaling Group : 
							Minimum & Maximum Limit
							
								Minimum 10 VM should be up and running
								Miximum 500 VMs should be up and running

								Scale-up 	===> Adding more VMs 
								Scale-Down	===> Removing the VMs 

								Storage : Initially we have assigned 1TB of EBS
								CPU :
								RAM :
								Network traffic :
								
								
								Database : --> RDS Service 
								
										1000 users access this machine
										
										50000
