Fundamentals of Linux Operating System ::

Overview of Linux
Linux Architecture
Linux Distributions
Basic Linux Commands
File Permission Management
User Creation
Shell Scripts
SSH and VI Utility - Remote Server Access
			
			

	Operating System ::
	
		What is an Operating System ???
		
			- Is an interface between the user application and the Hardware.
			
		Windows
		Linux 
		Mac 
		
		Android 
		
		High End computation Servers 
		
			- Reliable OS
			- Linux Based OS 
			
			OS Architecture ::
			
				Linux - Kernel is the core of Linux 
				
				Manage the Underlying Hardware, User Applications, External Resources,  
				
				It create the process 
				Each and every process runs in its own address space/volume 
				Dedicated/Isolated path
				
					OS Kernel 
						Namespace 
						Control Group 
						
						
				Executed as Command Line Utilities 
				
				Traditional Linux are CUI (Command User Interface) Based  
				
				Windows are GUI (Graphical User Interface) based  
		
		Linux Distribution :::
			
			AWS Cloud --> Ubuntu v22.04			===> 	Azure --> Ubuntu v22.04
			
			
			
			- Linux Distribution 
									Package Manager (Used to Install/Uninstall/Upgrade the packages)
				Debian/Ubuntu			apt-get / apt 
				Centos/RHEL				yum 
				Fedora					dnf
				Previous version of Fedora uses yum package manager	

				All the package Manager should be executed as a root user.
				
				
			
		Basic Linux Commands :::
		
		
		sudo -i			# To elevate the access to root level
		hostname -i
		clear
		ls 
		pwd 			# present working directory

	- Linux Distribution 
							Package Manager (Used to Install/Uninstall/Upgrade the packages)
		Debian/Ubuntu			apt-get / apt 
		Centos/RHEL				yum 
		Fedora					dnf
		Previous version of Fedora uses yum package manager	
		
	Why we need Linux ???
	
		Linux OS 
		
			Install and Manage all the DevOps Tools on Linux Machines  
			
			Open-Source DevOps Tools :
			
				git,jenkins,docker,kubernetes/Prometheus/Grafana,ansible,terraform
				
				
	
	What is your role here ???
	
	
		1. Install the DevOps Tools 
		2. Manage the Tools -- Periodically Clean-up/Upgrade the tools
		3. Remote access to the servers 
					Client - Server Architecture
					
					Server 
						- Client1,2,3,4,5
						
		4. DevOps Team can Administrate the Linux Machines 
		
			1. Package Management - install/uninstall/upgrade
			2. File Management 
			3. User Management 
			4. Access Management 
			5. Remote Server Management 
			6. Process Automation 
			
	Working with Linux OS :

	- Basic Linux Commands
			
			clear 
			
			root user will have complete admin access to Linux Machine.

	- Linux Distribution 
			Package Manager (Used to Install/Uninstall/Upgrade the packages)
		Debian/Ubuntu			apt-get / apt 
		Centos/RHEL				yum 
		Fedora					dnf
		Previous version of Fedora uses yum package manager				


	1. Package Management - install/uninstall/upgrade

	File related commands :::
	
	2. File Management 	
	
	Directory 		# Is folder - collections of files & sub-folders
		- File Access Mode
			- Read/Write/Execute
	
	
	For any user in Linux, will have a home directory
	
	pwd 			# show Present working directory
	
	cd 				# Change Directory 

	cd /			# Control will be take to the root directory at the system level 
	
	cd ~			# Control will be taken to the home directory of the user level
	
	exit 			# Used to logout from a user 

	ls 				# Used to List the files and directories of the current path

			echo "Session1" > file.txt 
			
			cat file1.txt 							# To print the content of the file 
			
		2. touch file2.txt 							# Used to create empty file 
		
		3. vi file3.txt								# Create or edit a file using vi editor
		
		
			Press i 								# goto insert mode 
			Type the file contents
			
			Press ===>		esc key 
			Type 	===>  	:wq						# Save and Exit from vi editor

	Eg.:
	
	payment.java 
	
	
	-rwx------					# Owner of the file can have Read / Write / Execute access.

	-rw-------					# Owner of the file can have Read and  Write access.

	-rwxr-----					# Owner of the file can have Read / Write / Execute access.
								# User Group can just read the file 
								
	-rwxrw-r--					# Owner of the file can have Read / Write / Execute access.	
								# User Group can just read & Write the file 
								# Common user can just read the file content

		- Setup the Access to that user 
		
		- Define ownership 
		
		
	DevOps :::
	
		Create some Virtual Machines :::
		
			server (VM)
				Clients (VM) 1,2,3,4,5 
				
				
		Create : devopsadmin user 
		
		Remote Server :::
		
			SSH Protocol :
			
				Host Name 
				
				User Name 
				
				User Credentials
	


		ls -a				# Used to get the list of all components including hidden files and directories


		Is SSH ::
		
			By Default :
			
				Key based authentication :::
				
					Public Key 
					
					Private Key 
					
			Password based authentication :::
			
			
		cd /etc				# Directory maintains all the packages and system properties 
		
		cat /etc/passwd		# Used to get the list of users 
		
		cat /etc/group 		# Used to get the list of user groups 
		
		
		user1

		docker group 
		
		devopsadmin 
		
		Group level Access
		
		
		Create New Linux User :::

			Excute these commands as a root user:	

			#useradd devuser1
			
			useradd devuser2 -s /bin/bash -m -d /home/devuser2		# Create User 
			
			su - devuser2											# Login to that user
			
		How to create password for Linux users 
				
				passwd <user_id>
				
				passwd devuser2										# Create Password 
				
				New Password :									 	# Is a Hidden field Enter valid password
