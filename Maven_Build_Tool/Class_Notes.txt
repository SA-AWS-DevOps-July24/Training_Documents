	Application Build Tool :::

		What is Application Build ?
		
				Build --> It is a process of Compiling the source code and create artifacts.
				
					Eg.: Java Program ==> High Level Language 
							Code Compilation 
							Create Artifacts --> Artifacts are the Binary Code(*.war/*.jar/*.exec)
		
		Build Tools 
			- Java Applications :
			
				- Maven / Gradle / Ant 
				
				
		Maven Build Tool :::
		
			- Is a Java Application Build Tool, used to compile the Java application source code, Perform Unit Testing, Create Artifacts. 
			
		
			Java Program :::
			
			javac - java compiler 
			
			
		Environment :
		
			Non-Prod Environments 
			
				Dev Environment:
					- Create Source Code 
					
				Build Environment:
					- Build the Source Code 
					- Build Tools like Maven 
					- Unit Testing 
						
				Test Environment :
					QA Testing 
					UAT Testing 
					
					
	Dev Environment:	
		
		Developers' Workflow ::

			1. Create Program : *.java 
			
			2. Compile 
			
			3. Create artifacts 
			
			4. Test the program - Unit Testing using Unit Testing Tool like JUnit
			
			5. Push the Changes to Remote github repository 
			
			Tools required to perform these activities :::
			
			Tools :::
			
				- Eclipse based IDEs - like Eclipse for Java,Pycharm,Intellij, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code
				- Source Code Management Tool - like github/AWS Code Commit/Azure Repos 
				- Jdk, Maven, JUnit Testing Tool, git  
			

			
	Build Environment:

		Using DevOps Approach ::
		Automate ::

		- Identify/Clone the Source Code from Github Repository 		
		- Build the code - Compile and create artifacts 					
		- Unit Testing 			
		- Verify the Unit Test Coverage 
		- Archive the Artifacts in the Artifactory Library 
		- Promote the Application to higher testing Environment(QA)					
		- Notify the Testing/Development Team 	

	Continuous Integration :
		- It is the capabililty of Application Development Team to Continously Integrate the Code Changes for further Testing, without impacting others.
		
		Tools :
			- Eclipse based IDEs - like Eclipse for Java,Pycharm,Intellij, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code
			- Source Code Management Tool - like github/AWS Code Commit/Azure Repos 
			- Jenkins/AWS Code Pipeline/Azure Pipeline, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible 


		Source Code -- Version Controlled using GIThub
		
			signin.java_v1.0 	---> Create Artifacts ==> signin.war_v1.0 
			signin.java_v1.1	---> Create Artifacts ==> signin.war_v1.1
			
			
		Artifactory Library -- Used to Version Control the Artifacts 
			- Jfrog Artifactory
			- Azure Artifacts 
			
			
			
		How to Perform Application Build, Unit Testing ?
		
			- Using Maven Build Tool 
				- Maven is Java Application Build Tool
				- Maven is used to Compile the Source Code 
				- Create Artifacts 
				- Perform Unit Testing
					(Unit Testing is a process of testing the changes done by the developers)
				- Maven can verify the Code Coverage 


sum(a,b)
{
a = 4
b = 5 
c = a + b 
return c
}


		Application Build Process :
		
			Input 	: Source Code 	-	*.java  (github repositories)
			
			Output 	: Artifacts 	- 	*.war 	(Artifactory Libraries)
			
		Maven - Build Tool
		
		How Maven Works ??
		
		
		Application Source Code Repository :
		
			Developer create POM.XML File to perform Maven Build
								
		Build Tools - Maven - used to build Java applications 
		
		Using Maven : 
			Application Build - Compile the code, create artifacts, perform unit-testing 

				- Build  - It is a process of compiling the source code and create artifacts(Binaries - *.war / *.jar/ *.exec) 
				- Unit Testing
	
		Maven Project :
		
			pom.xml - Project Object Model :
			
				- Will be part of the Java Application Project - Source Code Repository
				- It is used to define the properties of application artifacts 
				- It is used to define dependencies and the plugins required to perform build/unit-testing
	
			Maven Repository :		https://mvnrepository.com/
			
				- Maven Repositories Contains the Maven Dependencies and Plugins 
				- During Build, Maven refer to this Repositories and Download the Dependencies to perform Application Build, Unit Testing etc...
				
				Eg.: 
				Build Environment (VM) :::

					Build the application	--> Jdk, Maven 
					
					Unit Testing - Junit Testing Tool 
	
			Maven Goals : 
				This defines the actions we perform using Maven 
			
				● mvn compile 	- to compile the source code
				● mvn test 		- to compile and execute junit test cases
				● mvn package 	- to compile, test and create artifacts in the target folder of Project Library
				● mvn clean 	- to clean the target folder.

				Eg.: 
				
				mvn clean package 



			Java Web Application Project : - 

			My_Web_App - Folder 
			
			Maven Project Structure :::			# Java Maven Desktop/Console/terminal Application;

			MVN_Project1				# Project Name 
				src 
					main			# Maintain the source code *.java - Business Logic 
						*.java
					test			# Maintain the Test Cases and Test Data - JUnit 
						*.java
				target
					artifacts *.war / *.jar
				pom.xml 			==> defines the application artifacts, plugins and all the required depedencies
